The primary purpose of the Smart School Bus Application is to ensure the safety of students by providing real-time GPS-based tracking of school buses for parents, teachers, and school administrators.
It allows users to monitor the school busâ€™s location and arrival times and facilitates better communication between parents and school staff through a built-in chat feature. 
This Android application is available free of charge to parents, students, and faculty.
